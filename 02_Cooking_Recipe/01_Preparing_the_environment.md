After building our first website, now we will upgrade our level with new tags.
**üîÅ Reminder: **
We have covered the following tags:

- `<html>`
- `<head>`
- `<title>`
- `<body>`

This is now easier than drinking a cup of water. To prepare this project, do the following steps:

1. Create a folder for your new website, and call it `Cooking Recipe`.

   **For me:** I will be creating a new folder inside `Web Course`

2. Open your folder in VS code.

   **For me:** the path will be `Desktop/Web Course/ Cooking Recipe`

3. Create your `index.html`

4. Use the `html: 5` shortcut to add the starter code.

5. Remove the things that we don't need. (Hint: Remove the `<meta>` tags)

You should reach this reach this result:

1. Coping the `index.html` path

2. Opening Google Chrome.

3. Pasting the URL.
