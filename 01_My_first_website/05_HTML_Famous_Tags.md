Let's really write something that will appear on our websites!!

**01_Headings**

Websites have headings and their tags are written this way:

```html
<h1>I’m a heading</h1>
```

**📝 Note:**

> Notice that we said `headings` and that `<h>` has a 1 next to it, we have more than one heading. Actually to be more specific, we have six headings.

```html
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>
```

No `<h0>` and no `<h7>`, it is only these six that are provided from `HTML 5`.
**Now**

> how will you see your result on the page? That is a really good question.

We will do the following steps:

1. Right click and copy the path

   <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/4JjF7_XmIBl4Opl1hA5RL1WJrFknQRYMXJNmvgLTyvdxhflTZQCkXrUj8FenYoZ-d5HXQUat6YUjxEoKhCtig1bjGR4095JoivXyiXOPf0uJHrOYlXC92HpjffPlXzY_zYF1mxlW" alt="img" style="zoom:50%;" />

2. Now open Google Chrome

3. Past the link in the URL placement

4. Click Enter

   This code is only from writing this code:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <title>Document</title>
     </head>

     <body>
       <h1>Heading 1</h1>
       <h2>Heading 2</h2>
       <h3>Heading 3</h3>
       <h4>Heading 4</h4>
       <h5>Heading 5</h5>
       <h6>Heading 6</h6>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

   **📝 Note:**

   > Now to let our work continue appearing with each change, you need to refresh the browser page.

   **⚠ Common Mistakes:**

   > If you do not see the same result, check if you saved your work using the shortcuts. After every change we do in the code, you must save your work.
   > We can know if there was any change from the white circle, if it appears next to the file name then we need to save our work.

**02_Pharagraphs**

We can not write everything in headings, that is why HTML gave us a tag that is specifically used for the writing paragraphs. This tag is written in this way:

```html
<p>Hello, this is a paragraph</p>
```

After saving and refreshing the page, this will appear:

**⚠ Common Mistake:**

> Not making sure tags are closed the correct way, or forgetting to put a closing tag are two of the mistakes beginners may make.
> Try to avoid this mistake.

**03_Title**

Now for the <title> tag, we covered it before now let us change the title to `My first website`

```html
<head>
  <title>My first website</title>
</head>
```

Now the website will look like this:
