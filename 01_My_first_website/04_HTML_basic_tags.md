We can see that the HTML shortcut gave us a nice starter code to set su up.

1. DOCTYPE

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   ```

   This line is just giving any search engine a note that this page is built using ` HTML 5`, it is ok to remove it since all browsers will add it automatically.

   **üìù Note:**

   > HTML had a lot of upgrades throughout the years that now it reached version 5. This version is approved by all browsers.

2. HTML Tag

   ```html
   <html lang="en"></html>
   ```

   This tag will carry all the content of the html page

   **üìù Note:**

   > That this tag has an opening and closing tag
   >
   > ```html
   > <opening>
   >    Tag content
   > </ending>
   > ```
   >
   > Most HTML tags have a stating and an ending tag.In our case `<html>` is our starting tag and `</html>` is our ending tag.

   **üìù Note:**

   > `lang="en"` is saying that this html page is written in an English Language.

3. Head Tag

   ```html
   <head></head>
   ```

   First part in the code, it will contain the page properties and external links.

   **üìù Note: **

   > For now we can delete the `<meta>` tags that are in the head, if you are interested in what they do you can find the information by clicking here. In our case we do not need it, that is why I will delete it to keep our code clean.
   > **üìù Note: **

   If you noticed that the `<head>` tag also has a stating and ending, and include this tag inside it:

   ```html
   <title>Document</title>
   ```

   This tag is like `Bob` if you remember our Lego friend. Titles appear on the browser tab.

4. Body Tag

```html
<body></body>
```

The body will be the container of all our page content.

> Now after discussing the tags and deleting the `<meta>`, we will be left with this:

**üìùNote:**

> I do not know if you noticed it or not, did you notice the white circle on the top next to the file name?

This means that you have done some changes, but you did not save your work.
To save it use our beloved shortcuts:

- Windows: `ctrl + s`
- Mac: `cmd + s`

> Now our work is saved, the circle disappeared. `proud of you üëèüèª`
